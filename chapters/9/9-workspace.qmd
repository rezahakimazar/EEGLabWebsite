Workspace saves user defined settings. It also stores all the settings you make in the amplifier and configuration menus, the impedance measurement settings. You can set up multiple workspaces with different settings, and switch between these as you wish. This provides you with an easy way to access recording parameters that you use frequently.

::: {.callout-note title="Note"}
When you create or edit a workspace the parameter settings are automatically taken from the last workspace that was opened. As a result, you may need to adapt these settings for use in the current workspace.
:::

## Pre-requisites
1. An amplifier is selected  
2. The amplifier is connected to the recording computer

## How to Open/Create the Workspace (Wizards)

**Step 1:** Click on File > New Workspace... or File > Edit Workspace...  
**Step 2:** Data File Settings : to set all file related options

## Amplifier Settings 
The second page contains amplifier-specific parameters (1) and the channel table (2).

## Filter Settings

There are 3 Filter Methods:

1. **Raw Data Saving Filters**  
   Filters are directly applied to the raw data. Use of this filter is not recommended, because this changes the raw data. When using BrainVision Analyzer you can apply filters to the raw data. 

2. **Segmentation Filters**  
   When you specify segmentation (subsequent tab of the workspace wizard) you can also set filters for the segmented data. 

3. **Display Filters**  
   This filter only has an effect on the display on your screen. When you set the filter, you can switch it on and off during the data display by clicking on the Display Filter button.

## Segmentation / Averaging 
This dialog allows you to make optional settings for segmentation and averaging. 

## Saving 
When you click on **Finish**, the Save As dialog opens allowing you to save the workspace file. Give the file a meaningful name and click **Save**. 

## Electrode Position Files (EPF) 
Used to assign electrode names, positions, and physical channels in a workspace using predefined data from the cap manufacturer. It gives users the opportunity to adapt the electrode position data (for example, the physical channel). The EPF is written in XML format and is saved as a `.BVEF` file. This can be opened and edited in a text editor. The file has the following structure (see also the Analyzer Manual):

## Create Workspace Using an EPF

### Pre-requisites
1. An amplifier is selected  
2. The amplifier is connected to the recording computer  

*Step 1:* Click on File > New Workspace... or go to the Amplifier Settings dialog (second dialog page).  
*Step 2:* Click on **Use Electrode Position File**.  
*Step 3:* Select the checkbox **Read positions from Electrode Position File**.  
*Step 4:* Click on **Browse** and locate the electrode position file (*.BVEF). (If you want to check the file, click on **Preview**).  
*Step 5:* Click on **Import amplifier channel table**. Recorder takes over the assignment of channel names and physical channels. 

::: {.callout-note title="Note"}
Don’t click this button if you edit an existing workspace and want to keep the channel assignment. 
:::

*Step 6:* Click on **OK** to load the electrode positions (topographies).  
The electrode positions and the channel table (if applicable) are loaded into Recorder. The information is written into the header file. You can check the result in the impedance measurement window.
